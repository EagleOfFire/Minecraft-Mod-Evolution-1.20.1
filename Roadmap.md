Based on the provided document, here's a roadmap for developing the Minecraft mod:

---

### **Phase 1: Planning and Initial Setup**
1. **Define Functional Requirements**  
   - Implement a tier system governed by XP gains with daily limits.  
   - Introduce micro-quests for passive XP gains.  
   - ~~Allow clan assignment and specializations for players upon server entry~~.  
   - Develop token-based jutsu unlocking and spell system.  

2. **Establish Administrative Commands**  
   - ~~Commands for viewing and adjusting player stats without modifying tiers.~~ 
   - ~~Permissions for specific roles to control XP and stats.~~ 

3. **Outline User Experience (UX) Features**  
   - Notifications and sound effects for tier upgrades.  
   - Jutsu unlock notifications with hourly reminders.  

---

### **Phase 2: Core Systems Development**
1. **XP and Tier Progression System**  
   - Develop logic for life and chakra XP accumulation through micro-quests:  
     - ~~Stay connected for 10 minutes.~~ 
     - ~~Traverse 5000 blocks.~~
     - ~~Inflict/receive damage every 100 ticks (with cooldown).~~  
     - Daily login bonus.  

2. **Player Stats Management**  
   - Implement dynamic updates to life and chakra stats without resetting values.  
   - Include checks to verify the consistency between tiers and stats.

3. **Clan and Specialization Selection**  
   - Enable players to select a specialization freely.  
   - Support elemental progression with multi-element or mono-element paths.  

---

### **Phase 3: Feature Enhancements**
1. **Micro-Quests and XP Integration**  
   - Fine-tune XP gains and cooldowns to prevent farming abuse.  
   - Ensure AFK players do not earn passive XP.

2. **Token-Based Jutsu Learning System**  
   - Create an intuitive menu for players to redeem tokens for jutsus.  
   - Remove tokens upon jutsu acquisition.  

3. **Notification System**  
   - Add visual and audio feedback for milestone achievements.  
   - Provide periodic reminders for pending actions (e.g., unselected jutsus).

---

### **Phase 4: Administrative Tools**
1. **Commands for Moderators and Staff**  
   - ~~`/clanset` for assigning clans.~~
   - ~~`/givexp` to add XP bypassing limits.~~  
   - ~~`/sethp` and `/setchakra` for temporary stat changes during animations.~~  
   - `/statanim` to view personal stats.

2. **Debug and Monitoring Tools**  
   - Commands for inspecting tier and stat consistency (e.g., `/seepalier`).  
   - Log activity for potential abuse or errors.

---

### **Phase 5: Quality Assurance and Deployment**
1. **Testing**
   - Validate tier and XP systems under various scenarios (e.g., AFK, micro-quests, combat).  
   - Ensure administrative commands function correctly with appropriate permissions.  

2. **Feedback and Iteration**  
   - Collect input from staff and beta players.  
   - Adjust XP rates, cooldowns, and tier progression as needed.  

3. **Documentation**  
   - Prepare guides for players and administrators.  
   - Include troubleshooting steps for known issues.

---

### **Phase 6: Future-Proofing**
1. **Self-Updating Framework**
   - Implement a modular design for easy updates.  
   - Use scripts or automated processes for deploying changes.  

2. **Post-Launch Features**
   - Expand micro-quests or add new XP mechanics.  
   - Introduce advanced jutsu or clan-based abilities.
